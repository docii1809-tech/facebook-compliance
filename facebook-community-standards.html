        <h1>Ultimate Guide to Facebook Community Standards (2025)</h1>
        <p>In 2025, Meta's AI is stricter than ever. If you are a creator or a business owner, one "strike" can reduce your reach by up to 90% for 30 days. This guide breaks down exactly what you need to avoid.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Most removals are triggered by "Keywords." Use our <a href="facebook-compliance-checker.html">Facebook Checker</a> to scan your text before posting.

        <h2>1. Engagement Bait & Artificial Reach</h2>
        <p>Facebook's algorithm now penalizes posts that explicitly ask for engagement. Avoid phrases like "Share if you agree," "Comment YES," or "Tag a friend." Instead, ask open-ended questions that spark genuine conversation.</p>

        <h2>2. Regulated Goods & Health Claims</h2>
        <p>This is the #1 reason for ad account bans. In 2025, you cannot make "Absolute Health Claims." Avoid words like "Cure," "Guarantee," or "Instant Weight Loss." Meta requires that health results be presented as personal experiences, not universal promises.</p>

        <h2>3. Bullying & Harassment</h2>
        <p>Even "joking" with friends can get a post removed if the AI detects aggressive language. Avoid using "insult keywords" or calling out private individuals in a negative way.</p>

        <h2>4. Content Appeals</h2>
        <p>If your post was removed, do not delete it! If you delete the post, you cannot appeal. Always go to your Support Inbox and request a human review if you believe the AI made a mistake.</p>
